## Usage

### Dynamic Task Execution

Send your task description to the system using the WebSocket interface. The AGI system will:

1. Analyze the task using the MetaLearningAgent and RAG-enhanced LLM
2. Create a specialized DynamicAgent for the task, leveraging prior knowledge and experiences
3. Generate an optimized workflow using the WorkflowEngine and QuantumInspiredTaskOptimizer
4. Execute the task using the AdaptiveTaskExecutor, with real-time strategy adaptation
5. Continuously learn and improve using the FeedbackLoop and ContinuousLearner
6. Manage information entropy using the EntropyManager for optimal knowledge utilization

### API Endpoints

- `POST /execute_task`: Execute a task with real-time adaptation
- `POST /learn`: Submit learning data to improve the system
- `GET /get_compressed_knowledge`: Retrieve entropy-optimized compressed knowledge from the system

## Advanced Capabilities

- **Dynamic Tool Creation**: The system can create, test, and utilize custom tools on-the-fly to accomplish specific task requirements, adapting to new challenges in real-time.
- **Quantum-Inspired Optimization**: Leverages quantum computing concepts for enhanced task planning, execution, and NLP processing.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improves its performance by learning from each task execution, user feedback, and real-time adaptation strategies.
- **Entropy Management**: Optimizes knowledge storage, retrieval, and exploration, balancing between exploitation of known information and exploration of new possibilities.
- **RAG-Enhanced Decision Making**: Utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation to provide agents with relevant context from the knowledge graph, improving decision quality.
