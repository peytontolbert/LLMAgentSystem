## 1. System Overview

The Advanced LLM-based Agent System is a comprehensive solution for automating software development tasks using artificial intelligence. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to create intelligent agents capable of understanding, planning, and executing complex development tasks.

Key features include:
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Virtual development environment
- Dynamic skill system
- Knowledge graph for information storage and retrieval
- Natural language processing for task interpretation
- Code generation and analysis
- Project management with version control integration

## 2. Architecture

The system follows a modular, microservices-based architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. The main components are:

- Main Application: FastAPI-based server handling API requests and WebSocket connections
- Agent System: Manages the creation and coordination of LLM-based agents
- Virtual Environment: Simulates a development environment for safe code execution
- Physical Workspace: Interfaces with the actual file system
- Task Management: Handles task breakdown, prioritization, and workflow execution
- Skill System: Modular system for agent capabilities
- Knowledge Management: Stores and retrieves information using a graph database
- Natural Language Processing: Interprets user inputs and generates human-readable outputs
- Code Generation and Analysis: Produces and evaluates code
- Project Management: Handles multi-file projects and version control
- User Interface: Provides CLI and web-based interaction
- Security and Ethics: Ensures safe and ethical operation
- Logging and Monitoring: Tracks system activities and performance
- Error Handling and Recovery: Manages failures and adapts to errors
- Extension and Plugin System: Allows for easy system expansion
- Configuration and Environment Management: Handles system settings and runtime environments

## 3. Components

### 3.1 Agent System
The Agent System is responsible for creating and managing LLM-based agents. It consists of:

- Agent: Base class for all agents, containing core functionalities
- AgentFactory: Creates specialized agents based on task requirements
- MultiAgentCollaboration: Enables agents to work together on complex tasks

### 3.2 Virtual Environment
The Virtual Environment simulates a development environment, allowing agents to work safely without affecting the real file system. Key features:

- File and directory manipulation
- Code execution sandbox
- Environment variable management

### 3.3 Skill System
The Skill System provides a modular approach to agent capabilities. It includes:

- SkillManager: Registers, retrieves, and executes skills
- Base Skill class: Template for creating new skills
- Built-in skills: CodingSkill, RefactoringSkill, TestingSkill, etc.

### 3.4 Knowledge Management
The Knowledge Management system uses a graph database (Neo4j) to store and retrieve information. Components include:

- KnowledgeGraph: Interfaces with the graph database
- LearningEngine: Updates the knowledge graph based on agent experiences
- QueryEngine: Performs complex queries on the knowledge graph

## 4. API Reference

### 4.1 REST API Endpoints

#### Projects
- `POST /projects`: Create a new project
- `GET /projects/{project_id}`: Retrieve project details
- `PUT /projects/{project_id}`: Update project information
- `DELETE /projects/{project_id}`: Delete a project

#### Tasks
- `POST /projects/{project_id}/tasks`: Create a new task
- `GET /projects/{project_id}/tasks/{task_id}`: Retrieve task details
- `PUT /projects/{project_id}/tasks/{task_id}`: Update task information
- `DELETE /projects/{project_id}/tasks/{task_id}`: Delete a task

### 4.2 WebSocket Events

- `task_update`: Sent when a task status changes
- `agent_message`: Sent when an agent produces output
- `error_notification`: Sent when an error occurs

[Continue with other WebSocket events...]

## 5. Configuration

The system uses environment variables for configuration. Key variables include:

- `DATABASE_URL`: URL for the main database
- `NEO4J_URL`: URL for the Neo4j graph database
- `LLM_API_KEY`: API key for the LLM service
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

[Continue with other configuration options...]

## 6. Deployment

The system can be deployed using Docker containers. Key steps:

1. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t llm-agent-system .`
2. Run the container: `docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent-system`

For production deployment, consider using Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling.

## 7. Extending the System

### 7.1 Creating New Skills
To create a new skill:

1. Subclass the base Skill class
2. Implement the `execute` method
3. Register the skill with the SkillManager
